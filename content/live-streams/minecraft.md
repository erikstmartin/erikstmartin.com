My kids are home from school and they have expressed interest in learning to program. So i've decided to try to
    introduce them to that world, in a hopefully much more entertaining way than starting with theory.

It turns out the Bedrock edition of Microsoft can be modded using JSON and Javascript. This is a great way of easing
    into programming. There was so much we could do and quickly by just modifying JSON files. I started a several week
    streaming series on making addons with Minecraft.
